CS 456  Digital Image Processing
Morphological Biometrics and Edge Strength Detection
======================================================================================================

Dependencies:

python3
scipy
numpy
scikit-image

======================================================================================================


We have implemented our functions in Python.
Morphological functions are defined in morpho.py.

You can run our routine for processing an image with 
python process.py

Modify process.py to indicate which image you want to process.

Our Edge Strength detection is in EdgeStrength.py.

You can run an interactive demonstration of the edge strenth detection
with the command:
python EdgeStrength.py

We credit

Stéfan van der Walt, Johannes L. Schönberger, Juan Nunez-Iglesias, François Boulogne, Joshua D.
      Warner, Neil Yager, Emmanuelle Gouillart, Tony Yu and the scikit-image contributors

for the image processing code in scipy, as well as

Jones E, Oliphant E, and Peterson P for scipy itself.

Also, some of our methods were inspired by:
