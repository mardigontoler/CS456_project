 Edge Strength Transform adn Demonstration

 IDEA: Continuously find hit or miss transforms of image
 with a solid stucturing element. At each stage, find the edges of the
 current image.
 Form a new image (floating point) of normalized sum of all of the edge detected images
 Result should be an image of edges where intensity is related to thickness of edges.

 uses edge detection from scikit-image
 We also extensively use the numpy n-dimensional array data structure
 and many of its methods.

 Similar to morphomatch, but marks the top left corner of the SE's
 location whenever.
 No padding necessarry.
 In it's current form, this marks the new image at
 the top left corner of the structuring element's position
 in I. This has the effect of "shrinking" I to the top left corner.
